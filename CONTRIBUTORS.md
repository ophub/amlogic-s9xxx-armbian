# Armbian contributors

First of all, thanks to [150balbes](https://github.com/150balbes) for the outstanding contributions and the solid foundation laid for using Armbian in Amlogic TV boxes. The [Armbian](https://github.com/armbian/build) system compiled here directly uses the latest source code from the official in real-time. The development ideas of the program come from tutorials from authors such as [ebkso](https://www.kflyo.com/howto-compile-armbian-for-n1-box). Thank you all for your dedication and sharing, allowing us to use the Armbian system in more boxes.

The [u-boot](https://github.com/ophub/u-boot), [kernel](https://github.com/ophub/kernel) and other resources used in this system are mainly copied from the [unifreq/openwrt_packit](https://github.com/unifreq/openwrt_packit) project, and some files are provided by users in [Pull](https://github.com/ophub/amlogic-s9xxx-armbian/pulls) and [Issues](https://github.com/ophub/amlogic-s9xxx-armbian/issues) of projects such as [amlogic-s9xxx-openwrt](https://github.com/ophub/amlogic-s9xxx-openwrt), [amlogic-s9xxx-armbian](https://github.com/ophub/amlogic-s9xxx-armbian), [luci-app-amlogic](https://github.com/ophub/luci-app-amlogic), [u-boot](https://github.com/ophub/u-boot) and [kernel](https://github.com/ophub/kernel). To thank these pioneers and sharers, from now on (this source code repository was created on `2021-09-19`), I have recorded it uniformly in [CONTRIBUTORS.md](https://github.com/ophub/amlogic-s9xxx-armbian/blob/main/CONTRIBUTORS.md). Thanks again to everyone for giving the box a new life and meaning.
