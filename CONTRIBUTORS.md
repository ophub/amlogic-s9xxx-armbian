# Armbian contributors

First of all, I would like to thank [150balbes](https://github.com/150balbes) for his outstanding contributions and a good foundation for using Armbian in the Amlogic box. The [armbian](https://github.com/armbian/build) system compiled here directly uses the latest official source code for real-time compilation. The development idea of the program comes from the tutorials of authors such as [ebkso](https://www.kflyo.com/howto-compile-armbian-for-n1-box). Thank you for your dedication and sharing, so that we can use the Armbian system in the Amlogic s9xxx box.

The `kernel` / `u-boot` and other resources used by this system are mainly copied from the project of [unifreq/openwrt_packit](https://github.com/unifreq/openwrt_packit), Some files are shared by users in [Pull](https://github.com/ophub/amlogic-s9xxx-armbian/pulls) and [Issues](https://github.com/ophub/amlogic-s9xxx-armbian/issues) of [amlogic-s9xxx-openwrt](https://github.com/ophub/amlogic-s9xxx-openwrt) / [amlogic-s9xxx-armbian](https://github.com/ophub/amlogic-s9xxx-armbian) / [luci-app-amlogic](https://github.com/ophub/luci-app-amlogic) / [kernel](https://github.com/ophub/kernel) and other projects. To thank these pioneers and sharers, From now on (This source code repository was created on 2021-09-19), I have recorded them in [CONTRIBUTORS.md](https://github.com/ophub/amlogic-s9xxx-armbian/blob/main/CONTRIBUTORS.md). Thanks again everyone for giving new life and meaning to the box.
